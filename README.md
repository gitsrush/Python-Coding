PS1. Program to test generalized hailstone numbers where xn = axn−1 +b if xn−1 is odd and xn = xn−1/2
if xn−1 is even where a and b are positive integers. For each of the a, b pairs less than or equal to 10, find
whether or not the sequence seems to converge. Once you can do that, tell me how many different holding
patterns the sequence converges to. For instance, when a = 3 and b = 5 then 1 ! 8 ! 4 ! 2 ! 1 this
is holding pattern. However, if we start with a different number, say 5 we get a different holding pattern
5 ! 20 ! 10 ! 5.

PS2. implement a Newey-West corrected OLS estimator with
autocovariance term. The robust variance covariance matrix for this Newey-West estimator is 
Vˆar(ˆ) = (X0X)−1X0ˆX(X0X)−1

PS3. Consider the following AR(1) model:
xt = a + px(t−1) + et
Generate data from this model. Then estimate the model using ordinary least squares. The estimated ˆp that
you will find will be biased. Write a the functional form of the bias via simulation.

PS4. Ridge regression: Code which perform L2 regularization. That is, solve OLS with a constraint that the L2 norm of
the betas is less than some threshold value.

PS5. Hierarchical clustering: A hierarchical clustering procedure from scratch (without using sklearn or a similar package) in
python.
